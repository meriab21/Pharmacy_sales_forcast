## Overview
This repository is used for week 3 challenge of 10Academy.

## Scenario
You work at Rossmann Pharmaceuticals as a Machine Learning Engineer. The finance team
wants to forecast sales in all their stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time.
Managers in individual stores rely on their years of experience as well as their personal
judgement to forecast sales.

The data team identified factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays,
seasonality, and locality as necessary for predicting the sales across the various stores.

Your job is to build and serve an end-to-end product that delivers this prediction to analysts
in the finance team.

## Approach
The project is divided and implemented by the following phases
- Exploration of customer purchasing behavior
- Prediction of store sales
  - Machine learning approach
  - Deep Learning approach
- Serving predictions on a web interface
